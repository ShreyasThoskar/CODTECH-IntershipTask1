OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Project : Password Strength Checker

![IINERNSHIP_TASK1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a26dda1d-9a17-459b-89d5-67c7baefc567)

Objective:
To develop a tool that evaluates the strength of user-provided passwords by analyzing their length, complexity, and uniqueness. The tool provides a clear assessment of password strength and actionable feedback to help users create secure passwords.

Key Activities:
* Password Strength Checking: The function check_password_strength evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, special 
  characters, and avoidance of common passwords.
* Pattern Matching: The re module is used to search for specific patterns (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters) in the password using regular expressions (re.search).
* Feedback Generation: Based on the password's strength, feedback is generated to help the user improve their password.

Technologies Used:
* Python: The code is written in Python, leveraging basic programming concepts like conditional statements, loops, and functions.
* Regular Expressions (re): The re module is used to match specific patterns in the password, such as digits, uppercase letters, and special characters.
* Standard Python Functions: Functions like input(), print(), and list manipulations (e.g., append()) are used.

Key Insights:
* Password Complexity: Password strength is determined by multiple factors, including length, character variety (upper, lower, digits, special characters), and avoiding commonly used passwords.
* Regular Expressions: Using re.search() simplifies the task of identifying specific patterns in strings, making it easier to evaluate password strength efficiently.
* Feedback Mechanism: Providing clear and actionable feedback helps users improve their passwords by addressing specific weaknesses.
* Security Considerations: Common password checks (like "123456" or "password") help mitigate weak password choices and encourage users to create more secure passwords.
* Scoring System: The scoring system helps categorize passwords into "Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong", offering a simple yet effective way to convey security level to users.
